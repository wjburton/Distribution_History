**When was it created?
The original paper by gosset was published in biometrika was released in 1908

**Why was it given the name student's t-distribution?
(So the story goes)
William Sealy Gosset worked at Guinness Brewing, which prohibited its employees from publishing any papers, regardless of the contained information. For this reason, instead of using his real name, william used the pseudonym "Student" to avoid getting in trouble with his employer.

The test became well known through the work of Ronald Fisher, who called the distribution 'Student's distribution' and represented the test statistic with the letter t.

**Who created/discovered this distribution?
William Sealy Gosset

**How was it discovered/created?

**What are the important parameters of this distribution?
degrees of freedom

**What are the equations for the pdf and cdf?

**Where does this distribution occur in nature?
Students distribution does not occur naturally, it occurs because one is estimating a parameter that is normally distributed from a small sample size. As the sample size increases, students distribution becomes the standard normal distribution.

**Why Was it discovered/created?
Gossett was running into the problem of trying to estimate the mean using a small sample size. What he realized was there were two sources of uncertainty: 1) Owed to the error of random sampling, the estimated mean deviates more or less widely from the population mean, and 2) the sample is not sufficiently large to determine what is the law of the distribution of the individuals. In other words, we cannot say with confidence what distribution the data follow.

The usual method of determining the probability that the mean of the population lies within a given distance of the mean of the sample, is to assume a normal distribution about the mean of the sample with a standard deviation equal to s/sqrt(n) 

This method works well when the sample size is large because we can accurately estimate s, but when the sample is small, s itself (the sample standard deviation) becomes itself subject to an increasing error. 

Students distribution is used because it is a more accurate distribution when estimating the mean of a normally distributed variable. At a large enough sample size, students distribution matches the standard normal distribution.

**What are the applications of the distribution today?
It is used anytime you are estimating a parameter that is known to be normally distributed. 
Some specific applications are: Beta coefficients in a regression, Building confidence intervals around such parameters, hypothesis testing aroung such parameters,

**When is it used? It is used in cases where the parameter of interest is expected to follow a standard normal distribution and the population standard deviation is unknown.
